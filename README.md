# Library Management Software using JavaFX
This is a library management software developed using JavaFX programming language. The entire development video with explanation of each and every part (in realtime) is availe in my YouTube Channel [Genuine Coder Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhs1urmduZ29jTcE1ca8Z6bZNvH_39ayL).

This software is currently in development stage. So, it is not yet ready for use in libraries :-)

### Libraries Used
  * [JFoenix](https://github.com/jfoenixadmin/JFoenix) - JavaFX Material Design Library
